# Rennie Gaming: SA-MP Server UCP.

This is the user control panel I designed back in **January 2017**. This was my first big project and I was getting familiar with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Webpack-Yeoman. It was a fun experience.

You can have the source files, as they are just prototypes and they don't include any sensitive information.

_Note that I was also a founder on this project. I'm not sharing anything, that was not my own._
