# Rennie Gaming: SA-MP Server UCP.

I designed and developed front-end of the Rennie RPG's landing page, user/game panel, community forum back in April(?) 2017.

Rennie RPG was my first project and I was getting familiar with HTML, CSS, jQuery (vanilla js was a scary thing for me back in the days.). It was a fun experience.
